### RecruitingCode 🧠💡

Hello and welcome to RecruitingCode!

This page is designed and maintained by a **REAL LIFE RECRUITER**... not a career coach, not a LinkedIn influencer, just a normal recruiter working in high-tech 😱

I do not make any money from this page or any content I create, nor do I want to. I believe in open-source, and I want to create a space where I can help others with genuine, unbias, real life recruiting insights without outside pressure 

Below you'll find a list of candidate centric topics that I will discuss:

- Types of Recruiters - _how to tell, and what to look out for_
- Building an effective Resume
- How can I tell if I am a good candidate?
- Discussing compensation
- Nailing your behavioral interviews

Beyond this, I'll look to share my own state of hiring updates here and there, with a sprinkle of recommendations from those that find this content helpful! 

For now sit back, appreciate the emoji's, and please excuse my markdown 👀

Stay Tuned! 

🕺🏻
