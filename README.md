### RecruitingCode 🧠💡

Hello and welcome to RecruitingCode!

This page is designed and maintained by a real life recruiter... not a career coach, not a LinkedIn influencer, just a normal recruiter working in high-tech. I do not make any money from this page or any content I create, nor do I want to. I believe in open-source, and I want to create a space where I can help others with genuine, unbias, real life recruiting insights without outside pressure. 

Overtime you will see me add to this page, but for now sit back, offer content suggestions, and please excuse my markdown.

Stay Tuned!
